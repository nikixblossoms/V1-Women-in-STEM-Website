  <h1> WOMEN IN STEM </h1>

  <h3>"Prior to the 1980s, computer science was a field dominated by women. Many of the foundational algorithms, ideas,
    and papers that created the field were written by women."</h3>

  <h2> Introduction: Our Mission Statement </h2>
  <p> Women have been underrepresented in STEM fields for decades, especially with a significant decline in the most
    recent years. As a result, many women lack role models, face sexism, or discourage themselves from pursuing STEM
    careers. However, we plan to uplift and encourage women to pursue STEM careers in the future by providing a platform
    for women to gain insight into the fields of computer science, learn how to code, and build a welcoming space for
    women to connect and support each other.</p>

  <p><strong> By becoming a women in computer science, you can help bridge the gender gap and create a more inclusive industry! </strong><p>
