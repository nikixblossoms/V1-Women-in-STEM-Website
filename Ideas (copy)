Inspiring Women In Computer Science 

" Imagine walking into your first Computer Science class, looking around and noticing that you are the only girl in a room full of boys. You also quickly realize that the boys either pretend you are not there or talk right over you. That was the experience of Serena Sang, who is now a Grade 11 student at Victoria Park Collegiate Institute in Toronto. Instead of accepting the status quo, Serena founded a girls coding club with support from Ms. Shirley Xie, a computer science teacher at her school."

PROBLEM: The representation of women in the computer science industry has seen a significant decline over the years. The percentage of women majoring in computer science has dropped from about 37% in 1984 to around 17% in 2023. Your challenge is to leverage your programming knowledge to devise a solution that can help bridge this gender gap in the field of computer science.

IDEAS:
Solution 1: Educational App for Women in Computer Science
A mobile application designed to spark interest in computer science among women. This app could include interactive coding lessons, real-world problem-solving exercises, and resources tailored specifically for women in computer science.

Solution 2: Women in Computer Science Data Visualizer
A platform showcasing data of contributions of women in the field, this project could inspire more women to pursue careers in computer science.

Solution 3: Networking App for Women in Computer Science
An app that connects women interested in computer science with mentors, peers, and resources. This platform could provide a supportive community for women in computer science, offering mentorship opportunities, study resources, and a space for discussion and collaboration.
