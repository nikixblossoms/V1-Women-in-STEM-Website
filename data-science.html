<h3>What is data science?</h3>
<p>Data science is the study of extracting critical insights from various data sources to help build a stronger and effective business. It combines approaches from numerous disciplines, including statistics, mathematics, computer science, and more, to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in data. Data science is the key to unlock the full potential of information and data through making information actionable by using massive volumes of data to predict behaviours and infer meaning and relations in a meaningful way. It has many uses and therefore, is set to be apart of every industry in the future.</p>

<!-- Future of Data Science -->
<h3>What is the future of data science?</h3>
<p>The field of data science is expected to grow 22% from 2020 to 2030. Here are some other predictions, regarding the future of data science: </p>

<div class = "DSAF" >
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data science will become more automated.</strong> This doesn't neccessarily mean that AI will be taken over, but that most of the work will be done by an AI with data scientist overseeing and supervising the results of this process.</li>
  <li><strong>It's no longer about building the data model, but what the data can do.</strong> In the future, the focus of data science will shift from making models to leveraging them to take action based on the data. </li>
<li><strong>It's considered one of the most safest jobs.</strong> Data science can be applied to numerous fields and it will always be needed, considering how it can be applied to numerous fields and is very useful to build a stronger business, which will be explored in the next section.</li>
