Inspiring Women In Computer Science 

" Imagine walking into your first Computer Science class, looking around and noticing that you are the only girl in a room full of boys. You also quickly realize that the boys either pretend you are not there or talk right over you. That was the experience of Serena Sang, who is now a Grade 11 student at Victoria Park Collegiate Institute in Toronto. Instead of accepting the status quo, Serena founded a girls coding club with support from Ms. Shirley Xie, a computer science teacher at her school."
